# __Procedure & Developmental Approach__
<br />
The proccess we followed for the development of this project was fluid and at times AdHoc.
We based it on an Agile workflow and followed two day sprints.
This proved to be in most cases redundant as we worked closely together normally in the vicinty of one another.

The product was determined through a system of votes whereby we eliminated the product which was either too complex or least favoured.
For the first week we spent a lot of time researching and trying to spike basic functionality in order to better understand the stack we were working with while working toward a minimum viable product.
We disscussed a plan of action at the beggining of each day and had a retro toward the end of most days concluding the knowledge we had acquired and a demo of anything that had been built.
Most of the features and functionality for this project were developed in trios.

   ## __Story Board__

Our story board has a rudimentary layout for each page we expected to have after developing this app.

---

 - The PalmAlarm HomeScreen which allows you to move onto scanning or an info page.
 - Our scanning page with a manual input field.
 - Finally both formats of the results page; One that indicates a product scanned doesn't contain Palm Oil and a Second that indicates a product does contain Palm Oil.
 ---
 - The final three drawing were non-MVP ideas for further development had we enough time before needing to present the project.
