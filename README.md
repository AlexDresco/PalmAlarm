# __PalmAlarm__

## Outline

 Final engineering project for Makers Apprenticeship
This App was developed to scan barcodes on consumable produce and let the user know whether it contains Palm Oil products.

# Local Installation

#### Make sure you have the following installed: <br />
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) <br />
CLI installation: <br />
```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"``` <br />

* [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)(IOS Simulator) <br />
This can also be installed from CLI using: <br /> 
``` xcode-select --install ``` <br />

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.13.0/node-v10.13.0.pkg) (The version used for this project was 10.13.0)

<br />

Then clone the project repo locally: <br />

``` git clone https://github.com/AlexDresco/PalmAlarm.git ```

* Then move into the project's root directory and run the following: <br />
    ``` npm install -g expo-cli ``` <br />
    ``` npm install ``` <br />
    ``` npm install react-native-animatable --save ```
<br />

# Testing

* To run tests:<br />
    ``` npm test ```

** _We have had conflicts between testing suites and our tech stack. We decided to focus on funcionality testing and integration testing following the advice given by coaches however we faced numerous problems with Expo and Enzyme._

<br />

# __Procedure & Developmental Approach__
<br />
We set out to follow Agile practices, however given the small group and close working patterns (regularly swapping teams and making group decissions) our updates and design changes were not confined to the end of sprints, but we were able to solve problems and make desisions as and when they came up.

To decide upon the product we would create, we first individually came up with ideas, and then presented them to the group. After discussing both the technical viability of the project as well as the use of the project, we agree upon a final product. An app that scanned products for palm oil or palm oil derrivatives gave us the chance to use a tech stack that we were interested in whilst tackling a contempary issue.

For the first week we spent a lot of time researching and trying to create basic functionality in order to better understand the stack we were working with while working toward a minimum viable product. We disscussed a plan of action at the beggining of each day and had a retro toward the end of most days concluding the knowledge we had acquired and a demo of anything that had been built. Most of the features and functionality for this project were developed in pairs or threes.

   ## __Story Board__

Our story board has a rudimentary layout for each page we expected to have after developing this app.

---

 - The PalmAlarm HomeScreen which allows you to move onto scanning or an info page.
 - Our scanning page with a manual input field.
 - Finally both formats of the results page; One that indicates a product scanned doesn't contain Palm Oil and a Second that indicates a product does contain Palm Oil.
 ---
 - The final three drawing were non-MVP ideas for further development had we enough time before needing to present the project.
